## Introduction
Welcome to the Projectile Motion with Aerodynamic Drag model, a C++ codebase that explores the dynamics of projectiles in the presence of aerodynamic drag. This toolkit serves as a valuable learning resource for students of physics, aerodynamics, and engineering, offering practical insights into how aerodynamic drag influences the motion of physical bodies. The model numerically computes key variables of interest, such as velocity, speed, range, maximum height, and time of flight, for well-known 2D projectile motions with and without aerodynamic drag. This README file provides a detailed overview of the project, its objectives, functionalities, and instructions for usage.

## Getting Started
To use the Projectile Motion with Aerodynamic Drag model, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. This codebase utilizes standard C++ libraries, making it compatible with most compilers. To set up the environment, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/username/projectile-motion-aerodynamic-drag.git

Compile the main C++ file:
g++ projectile_motion.cpp -o projectile_motion

Run the executable:
./projectile_motion

## Model Overview
The C++ code in this repository models projectile motion in the presence of aerodynamic drag. It implements well-known 2D projectile motions, such as projectile motion under gravity and straight-line motion, and numerically computes their kinematic characteristics with and without aerodynamic drag. The model considers drag force as a function of velocity, mass, and drag coefficient, allowing users to observe the significant effects of aerodynamic drag on projectile motion.

## Features
The Projectile Motion with Aerodynamic Drag model offers the following features:

Simulation of 2D Projectile Motion: The model simulates the motion of projectiles in a 2D plane, considering both gravity and aerodynamic drag.

Comparison with No Drag Case: The model computes projectile motion variables, including velocity, speed, range, maximum height, and time of flight, for both the cases with and without aerodynamic drag, enabling a comprehensive comparison.

User Interaction: Users can easily modify parameters such as initial velocity, angle of launch, mass, and drag coefficient to observe how these factors impact the projectile's trajectory.

Visualization: The model provides visual representations of projectile trajectories for better understanding.

Learning Resource: This toolkit serves as a valuable learning resource for physics, aerodynamics, and engineering students, enhancing their practical understanding of aerodynamic drag effects on projectile motion.
